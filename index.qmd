## Welcome to the 2024 CCCM Cluster Update

This is the home page for updates related to CCCM Cluster Somalia. The navigation bar at the top provides quick access to different sections.

### Capacity Building

The Monthly Narrative Reporting consolidates data and information from all existing tools, not just the monthly reporting template.  
As you noted, submissions via the Kobo tool have been limited, with only PSA and IRW contributing data in recent months. This data/inputs received through the Monthly Reporting Tool (Kobo) alone is insufficient to produce the comprehensive reports currently being generated.

Oscar has been compiling and sharing all quantitative information from various sources, including the Excel 4W submissions shared by partners, with the coordinators. Moreover, I have emphasized to the cluster team that IOM has consistently submitted monthly updates for all its activities through the Excel 4W/monthly reporting format since April, a submission that Oscar is also recipient of.
